# Vybinx – An Android Music Player Application
@shobhit-coder , @AneeshCRao

Our project, an android mobile music player application offers users simplicity and capability at their fingertips. In addition to offering standard features provided by most music player application, our application boasts an innovation that offers a unique touch for music lovers. The application’s functioning can be abstracted into four main features which are described in this document. 
Song listing and selection
The first feature of the application provides the user with a list of all the audio files present on the phone. The songs are presented to the user as a List view. The users can make their selection from the list and the chosen song is played by the media player.
 
## Music player window
The application provides a music player window as the second feature. This feature allows users pause, rewind and fast-forward their songs, in addition to navigating through their music. They are also provided with a seekbar to jump to different parts of the current song.
 
## Favourites
Want to listen to your favourite songs without needing to skip ahead each time? Our application provides a feature to group your favourite songs into a list so you can listen to them peacefully without having to bother switching songs each time.
 
## Guess Music
Are you ever at a party, and a song comes on that really sticks in your head, and never goes out no matter what? And all you can think of is that song, but you don’t know the name of the song, and you don’t even find it when you Google the “few” lyrics that you’re singing on-and-on to yourself.
Our application offers a solution to this problem. Using the Musicxmatch Track Search API, the application can predict the name and artist of the song, along with providing a YouTube link to the song, using YouTube Data API, with merely a single lyric (and the artist; optional, for better results) provided by the user. This is the stand-out feature of our application.
